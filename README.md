1. Briefly describe what the code is supposed to do.

The code is supposed to be a rotation timer alarm for swarms. There is a queue of users, and the current user switches off once the time is up for that shift.


2. Does the code work? If not, what's broken.

Yes, the code works.


3. How is the code better than what the team currently has?

The display of the queue is visually nicer than what the team currently has.


4. How is the code worse?

The overall UI is too much text, and hard to know what to focus on.


5. How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?

2 tries. I think it would be harder once more features are implemented (i.e. queue manipulation, connecting it to a database, etc.


6. Overall impression of the experience

It was helpful to know how to prompt gen AI for help with code, but I would not use it to write my code completely from scratch.
